## New Features

  - Introduce an API (C-based) in `f4ncgb.hpp` that can start basis

  - Add a handler for SIGUSR1 that prints the basis that has already
    been computed up to this point.
  - Add support for shared library builds.
  - Add support for dumping the stores at destruction (enable with
    CMake-option `-DENABLE_STORE_DUMP=ON`).
  - Add CMake-options `ENABLE_TEST` and `ENABLE_SIGNAL` for toggling
    the generation of the test binary and inclusion of signal-handler
    code in the f4ncgb binary. (thanks to Benjamin Lorenz)
  - Fix compilation issues on MacOS and with pthreads (thanks to
    Benjamin Lorenz)
